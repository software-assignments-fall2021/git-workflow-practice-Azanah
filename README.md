# Ada Lovelace
Some thoughts on a [NYT article]<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-ada-lovelace.html> about Ada Lovelace. 

I think it is so amazing that Lovelace did so much theoretical work that impacting computing decades before the first computers would exist. I love that she thought of math as being poetic, I feel like often we are taught that arts and sciences are oposites, it is refreshing to see them combined.
